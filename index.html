            <h4> 
                    I am a very talkative person who tries my best to set the mood of the room to that of a positive one. Jumping at the opportunity whenever needed, I can lead my peers towards the goal we are trying to achieve while making sure everyone's voices are heard. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am currently a Junior in High School hoping to pursue a career in either Software Development, Game Development. Applying my programming skills hands-on from the classroom to the unique environment of FIRST Robotics, I am no stranger to the fast-paced schedules and time crunches that come with the profession. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Besides my passion for programming and Computer Science, another passion of mine is creative writing. Writing many poems and stories, I hope to submit these writings to Scholastic's Art and Writing Competition this coming September. Using these skills that I have gathered and practiced over the years, if my career in the Computer Sciences ever falls through or I feel that it is just not for me, I hope to pursue a career as an Author and/or Video Game Writer.
